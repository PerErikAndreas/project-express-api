# Project Express API

The assignment was to use a JSON to create a Express API with 2 or more Routes and deploy it to google clouds, so this was only backend.

## The problem

The problem was that I wanted to show my kids what I had done so I made a front-end in React. I also later made my own JSON API about clouds and added some funny stuff to GET from it and connected it with a fetchcall to the frontend.
